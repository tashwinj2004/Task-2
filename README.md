# Task-2
I worked on the market sales dataset by uploading it into Power Query, where I transformed and prepared the data for visualization. In the model view, I established relationships between tables using primary and foreign keys. I then created calculated columns and DAX measures to support analysis. Using these, I developed a dashboard that highlights key business insights such as total transactions and profit. Additionally, since the market operates across multiple U.S. locations, I incorporated a map visual to display sales performance by location.

Note: All the 3 images are from the same dashboard, they represent the values changing when I select each attribute.
